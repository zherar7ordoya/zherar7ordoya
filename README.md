# Hi, I'm Gerardo Tordoya! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub space, where I combine logic, creativity, and a passion for technology to create innovative solutions. 🚀

## 🌟 About Me

I'm a **recently graduated Analyst Programmer**, with previous experience as a consultant in billing for advertising services, acting as a liaison between accounting departments and development teams. During this time, I implemented technological solutions that optimized operational processes, including automated tools in Excel VBA.

My development approach is focused on robust and sustainable solutions. Through my training in **C#** and **.NET**, I have specialized in creating solid and scalable applications, avoiding the temptation to follow technological trends that do not provide the same stability. My experience with web technologies and emerging tools, initially gained through **freeCodeCamp**, made me realize that a more structured and in-depth approach, like the one **C#** offers, is what truly ensures success in professional software development.

Currently, I'm in a continuous process of updating my skills, integrating modern technologies such as **ASP.NET** and **MAUI**, while reinforcing my knowledge in object-oriented software architecture design.

## 🔭 Currently...

- 🔭 **Working on:** Small self-learning projects.
- 🌱 **Exploring:** MVC and microservices architectures.
- 🎯 **Interested in:** Lightweight and serverless systems with persistence in **SQLite** and **LiteDB**, modular design, and simplicity as a development philosophy.

My focus is always on finding efficient and scalable solutions, evaluating emerging technologies with a long-term mindset.
