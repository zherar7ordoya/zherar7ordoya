# Tranquility Base - Dark & Light theme, easy on the eyes

## Supported Languages 
Polished support for ES6 (JavaScript), HTML, CSS, SCSS, Markdown, JSON. General support for most other languages, based on the colors used for JavaScript.

## Inspiration, Philosophy, Etc.
[Tranquility Base][1] - Where the astronauts landed on the moon for the first time.

> Houston, Tranquility Base here. The _Eagle_ has landed. _- Neil Armstrong, from the surface of the Moon_

With **Tranquility Base Dark**, I am attempting to apply the design philosophy of [Daobeam][2] to a dark theme.

**Tranquility Base Light** uses slightly modified versions of the **Daobeam** core colors.

## On Contrast Level
I am not a fan of high-contrast themes like Monokai. For me, they are like when you go into the showroom and see the television sets blasting big, bright colors - and when you get the set home, you realize you need to tone it down in order to watch it for long stretches.

Describing the contrast "level" of a theme is a subjective thing. For me, it basically means how much the foreground colors contrast with the background color, and how much the foreground colors contrast with each other. It also describes the overall "feel" of the theme.

I would describe **Tranquility Base Dark** as a mid-contrast theme, and **Tranquility Base Light** as a low-contrast one - even lower than **Daobeam**.

## About **Tranquility Base**
All colors are meant to compliment each other. I have attempted to harmonize colors using [a professional tool][0].

CSS: Property values are all the same color (good!).

Comments: Consistent contrast level compared to other code. Theme designers: we already understand that comments are not processed as code. We don't need a visual indication (making them ultra-low contrast, etc.). **We should be able to read comments just as easily as code!**

I am open to pull requests and constructive feedback. I would like to see polished support for many other languages, particularly back-end languages. If you like **Tranquility Base**, please review it.

## User Settings Recommendations
VS Code user settings has properties to increase the font-size of the source code (`editor.fontSize`), the terminal (`terminal.integrated.fontSize`), but *not* the editor sidebar. Here is a workaround for this limitation: Increase the overall font-size of everything using `window.zoomLevel`, and then slightly *decrease* the `editor.fontSize` and `terminal.integrated.fontSize` to compensate for increasing `window.zoomLevel`:

```
{
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Tranquility Base Dark",
    "editor.fontFamily": "Consolas",
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "files.autoSave": "onFocusChange",
    
    //BEGIN these settings work in tandem ~~~~~~~~
    "window.zoomLevel": 0.7, // 0.7<-- keep this value in a comment, because it will be overwritten on ctrl + 0, ctrl + +, or ctrl + -.
    "editor.fontSize": 16, // smaller than I would want it if window.zoomLevel was 0
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 15, //smaller than I would want it if window.zoomLevel was 0
    //END these settings work in tandem ~~~~~~~~    
}
```
